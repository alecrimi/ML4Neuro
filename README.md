Welcome to the repository for the material of the course Introduction of Machine learning for Neuroimaging
The course is managed by **Prof. A. Crimi **.  

The goal of the course is to get familiar with neuroimaging data, and use machine learning to detect biomarkers for diseases.

The course alternates 1 week Lectures/Laboratories and 1 week Projects
There is no final exam. The grade is given by 50% on the handsout collected from the lab activities 1 week later (we switched from the 2 weeks of the last year), and final group project.
Each group project should be composed by 3-5 people. Multiple groups can choose the same project.

**Pre-requisites:**
Knowledge of Python, and basic Unix based system,
Understanding of machine learning and deep learning concept

No knowledge of anatomy or physiology is required, but the willingness to learn basic concepts is expected.

**Lab plans**  
For Crimi's group: room 4.28 building D17

We alternate sessions of guided lab activities and assigned projects:
from October 3rd until January 23rd 2024 

1. Data structures, tools, and brain tumor segmentation
   
2. From tractography to connectoma (MRTRIX & DiPy), fiber clustering

3. Classify functional connectome via oldschool machine learning tools

4. Graph convolutional networks on functional connectome EEG and metrics

5. Effective connectivity with Granger Causality

6. Generative adversarial networks in fMRI context

Assignments are represented as report-like document in PDF (either from Word or TEX) with screenshot and few comments
of what you obtained from the notebooks.
